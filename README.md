# STA141B-Final

For my STA141B project, I will be using a database from the New York Times.  Using my api key, I will build a dataframe containing information from their bestsellers list.  I will need to use the GET function twice.  One to get the names of all the NYT bestseller lists, and then another to actually grab the information from the lists such as title, author, and their rank on the list.  This is all done in my Main Code.RMD file.

My other file, app.R, build a shiny app that will visually display my dataframe.  Not only will it display the book cover, but also a boxplot showing the average rank for all the titles included in the list.
